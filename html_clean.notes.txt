Notes on how html_clean class is to work:

When processing an element:
	1	check if the element is valid
	2	check if element should be marked for deletion
	3	3a	if closing, check the stack and close any open tags above it in the stack
		3b	if opening, check the stack to see if it is valid within its direct parent
	4	Check attributes
		4a	check to see if attribute is valid or maked for deletion
		4b	check to see if attribute's value is valid
		4c	check to see if attribute and value mark it for deletion
		4d	check to see if attribute and value mark element for deletion
		4d	return valid attributes
	5	update stack
	6	6a	if element and children are marked for deletion, return empty strign
		6b	if element only is marked for deletion return non HTML string following tag
		6c	return clean element and trailing non HTML string
